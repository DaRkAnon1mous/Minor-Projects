## 1. Detailed Problem Formulation:
The problem revolves around creating a program in C that simulates the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The game involves two players who simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock. The program should allow users to input their choice and then determine the winner based on the choices made by both players.

## 2. Analysis of the Problem:
The core of the problem lies in creating a program that takes user input, compares it to another player's input, and determines the winner based on the rules of the game. Additionally, error handling for invalid inputs and a mechanism for replaying the game should be implemented.

## 3. Detailed Design Diagram:

START
|
|--- Display game instructions
|
|--- Prompt Player 1 to choose rock, paper, or scissors
|
|--- Prompt Player 2 to choose rock, paper, or scissors
|
|--- Compare choices to determine the winner
|
|--- Display the winner or a tie
|
|--- Ask if players want to play again
|
|--- If yes, loop back to prompt choices
